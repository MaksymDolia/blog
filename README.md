# Blog #
A web project represents blog. This project was created for training purposes. You can see it in action at http://blog-mxf.rhcloud.com/

The users are able to leave comments without being loged in, and can write posts (sign up and log in required).

The site supports users with disabled cookies and javascript.

I used the following technologies: Java, MongoDB, Servlet API, JSP, JSTL, JUnit, Jackson, Bootstrap, AJAX, HTML/CSS.
